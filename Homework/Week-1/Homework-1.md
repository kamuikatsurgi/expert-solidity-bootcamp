### Question 1

*Why is client diversity important for Ethereum?*

### Answer

The behavior of an Ethereum node is controlled by the client software it runs. There are several production-level Ethereum clients, each one developed and maintained in different languages by separate teams. The clients are built to a common spec that ensures the clients seamlessly communicate with each other and have the same functionality and provide an equivalent user experience.

Having many independently developed and maintained clients is vital for the health of a decentralized network. Let's explore the reasons why.

**Bugs**

A bug in an individual client is less of a risk to the network when representing a minority of Ethereum nodes. With a roughly even distribution of nodes across many clients, the likelihood of most clients suffering from a shared issue is small, and as a result, the network is more robust.

**Resilience to attacks**

Client diversity also offers resilience to attacks. For example, an attack that tricks a particular client(opens in a new tab) onto a particular branch of the chain is unlikely to be successful because other clients are unlikely to be exploitable in the same way and the canonical chain remains uncorrupted. Low client diversity increases the risk associated with a hack on the dominant client.

**Proof-of-stake finality**

A bug in a consensus client with over 33% of the Ethereum nodes could prevent the consensus layer from finalizing, meaning users could not trust that transactions would not be reverted or changed at some point. This would be very problematic for many of the apps built on top of Ethereum, particularly DeFi.

**Shared responsibility**

There is also a human cost to having majority clients. It puts excess strain and responsibility on a small development team. The lesser the client diversity, the greater the burden of responsibility for the developers maintaining the majority client. Spreading this responsibility across multiple teams is good for both the health of Ethereum's network of nodes and its network of people.

### Question 2

*Where is the full Ethereum state held?*

### Answer

The full Ethereum state is held in the global state trie, which serves as the single repository for all Ethereum accounts' information. This trie is continuously updated and contains key-value pairs for each account, with the key being a 160-bit identifier (the Ethereum account address) and the value encoding various details including nonce, balance, storage root, and code hash. The state trie's root node, a hash of the entire trie, serves as a unique identifier for the state at any given point in time. Additionally, each Ethereum block has its own separate transaction trie, where transactions are organized and accessed via their indexes within the block. The storage trie, housing contract data, is associated with individual Ethereum accounts, and a hash of its root node is stored in the global state trie. These trie structures are implemented using database software such as leveldb, with specific Patricia trie libraries enabling access to the data within the Ethereum installation.


### Question 3

*What is a replay attack?, which 2 pieces of information can prevent it?*

### Answer

A replay attack is a type of attack where a valid transaction or action is intercepted and maliciously repeated on a different network or at a different time, without the consent of the original sender.

To prevent replay attacks in smart contracts, two important pieces of information can be utilized:
- **nonce:** A nonce (number used once) is a value included in each transaction sent from an Ethereum account. By requiring that transactions include a nonce that increments with each transaction from the same sender, smart contracts can prevent replay attacks. This is because each transaction would have a unique nonce, and any attempt to replay a transaction with the same nonce would be rejected by the network as a duplicate.
- **chainId:** When signing a transaction, ensure that the chainId of the target network is included as part of the transaction data. This ensures that the transaction is specific to a particular blockchain network and cannot be replayed on other networks.

### Question 4

*In a contract, how do we know who called a view function ?*

### Answer

Here is an example solidity contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.21;

contract MyContract {

    function myViewFunction() public view returns (address) {
        return msg.sender;
    }
}

contract TestContract {

    MyContract instance;
    
    constructor(MyContract _instance) {
        instance = _instance;
    }

    function test() public view returns (address) {
        return instance.myViewFunction();
    }
}
```

So, in the following example:

- If `myViewFunction()` is called directly by an EOA, it will return the address of that EOA.
- If `myViewFunction()` is called by another smart contract, it will return the address of that smart contract.
